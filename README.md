<h1>Javascript Bootcamp Course<h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>JavaScript is the most popular programming language out there, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy to learn. You end up wasting time on out-of-date courses and incomplete YouTube tutorials that talk about a JavaScript features without showing how to use them when building real-world applications.</p>

<p>This comprehensive course covers the modern ES6 and ES7 JavaScript features used in the real world. You’ll gain an understanding of the latest cutting-edge language features.</p>

<p>Getting experience writing code on your own is a big part of learning JavaScript. That’s why I’ve included over 80 challenges designed to get you writing code, adding app features, and solving a wide range of problems. These challenges will give you the skills and confidence needed to create your own web application.</p>

<p>There are no starter projects here. You’ll see what it takes to launch a JavaScript application, from the first line of code to the final deployed application.</p>

<p>This course is not about watching videos, it’s about writing code. From the start, you’ll be building out each project from scratch as well as completing over 80 challenges designed to test and reinforce what you’ve learned.</p>

<h3>During the class, you’ll build three JavaScript applications:</h3>
<ol>
<li>The first app, a note-taking app, is our starter application. You’ll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript and see exactly what it takes to build a program that allows users to add, edit, delete, and save their notes.</li>

<li>The second app, a to-do application, you’ll be building on your own. This will test your skills and ensure that you have the real-world experience and problem-solving skills that are essential for writing JavaScript code.</li>

<li>The last app, a hangman word game, is used to explore the world of asynchronous JavaScript. You’ll learn how to set up applications that rely on data from third-party services that can offer up dynamic, real-time information such as the user’s current location.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Stay current in an ever changing world.</h3>
