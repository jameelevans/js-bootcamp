Description
Have you tried to learn JavaScript before?

JavaScript is the most popular programming language out there, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy to learn. You end up wasting time on out-of-date courses and incomplete YouTube tutorials that talk about a JavaScript features without showing how to use them when building real-world applications.

Sound familiar?

I built this course to teach you how to build and launch your own JavaScript web applications.

The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp starts from scratch and builds up your knowledge of the JavaScript language. Yes, you’ll learn all the features of the language, but you’ll also learn how to use those features together to create a complete application.

This comprehensive course covers the modern ES6 and ES7 JavaScript features used in the real world. You’ll gain an understanding of the latest cutting-edge language features.

Getting experience writing code on your own is a big part of learning JavaScript. That’s why I’ve included over 80 challenges designed to get you writing code, adding app features, and solving a wide range of problems. These challenges will give you the skills and confidence needed to create your own web application.

There are no starter projects here. You’ll see what it takes to launch a JavaScript application, from the first line of code to the final deployed application.

Who’s this course for?

1. People who are brand new to JavaScript. You want to dive into the world of programming and learn JavaScript. This might be your first programming course, or maybe you’ve worked with other languages before. Either way, you’re ready for this bootcamp.

2. People who currently use JavaScript but want a better sense of mastery over the language. You picked up little tricks and snippets of code because you needed to solve a problem. Now you’re ready to master JavaScript as well as explore the latest from ES6 and ES7.

You’ll learn JavaScript by doing, not watching.

This course is not about watching videos, it’s about writing code. From the start, you’ll be building out each project from scratch as well as completing over 80 challenges designed to test and reinforce what you’ve learned.

During the class, you’ll build three JavaScript applications:

1. The first app, a note-taking app, is our starter application. You’ll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript and see exactly what it takes to build a program that allows users to add, edit, delete, and save their notes.

2. The second app, a to-do application, you’ll be building on your own. This will test your skills and ensure that you have the real-world experience and problem-solving skills that are essential for writing JavaScript code.

3. The last app, a hangman word game, is used to explore the world of asynchronous JavaScript. You’ll learn how to set up applications that rely on data from third-party services that can offer up dynamic, real-time information such as the user’s current location.

Stay current in an ever changing world.

The world of JavaScript is always changing, and that’s why I work to keep this course as up-to-date as possible. You can join knowing you’ll be learning the fundamentals of the language as well as the new language features that keep coming out.

This course uses the latest language features from ES6 and ES7.

Everything you need comes in one easy-to-use package.

There’s no need to worry if you’re learning the right skills to land that JavaScript job or launch that JavaScript app. I’ve mapped out everything you need to know in an interactive, easy-to-follow package designed to get you up and running in a couple of weeks.

By the end, you’ll be able to build and launch your own applications.

There’s no better time to learn JavaScript.

You’ve made a smart choice, because JavaScript is the most popular programming language out there. This is no exaggeration. This popularity and growth means more jobs and opportunities than ever before.

JavaScript powers the web. That means every company out there uses JavaScript, and the demand for JavaScript developers is only increasing. Companies from Google and Apple to Udemy itself all use JavaScript extensively.

JavaScript doesn’t stop with the web. It has quickly become a universal programming language capable of anything. JavaScript can be used to create desktop apps, server-side applications, native iOS/Android applications, and so much more. This course is your ticket into that ecosystem.

Get access to fast support if you get stuck.

There’s nothing worse than getting stuck ten hours into a course and not getting the help you need to continue. Getting stuck is part of the learning process. That’s why I’m here to answer every single question that comes my way.

I’ll work with you to get you unstuck and back on track. It’s one of the reasons students love taking my courses. Don’t take my word for it. Check out the student reviews below.
